time, and without any notice.

the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that

provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.

Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
